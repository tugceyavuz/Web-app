Graduation project for Computer Engineering in Gebze Technical University 2024.

The project entails the development of a collaborative web application specifically
crafted for team-based brainstorming sessions. The application introduces three distinct
user roles: session manager, table leader, and participant, with an innovative inclusion
of ChatGPT as a participant. The primary objective is to facilitate a cohesive and
dynamic brainstorming environment that seamlessly integrates human and artificial
intelligence. The core methodology adopted is the 6-3-5 method, a structured creativity
technique, wherein each of the N participants, usually six, generates three ideas within
five minutes, fostering a systematic and efficient approach to idea generation within the
collaborative framework.
